<h1>All About Pandas:</h1>
<h2>By Shreyan Mitra</h2>
  <br>
  <h2 style = "font-size: 35px">Where are pandas from?:</h2>
	<ol class="customIndent" style = "background-color:darkseagreen; font-size: 20px">
	 <li>Pandas are generally found in <em>Southwest China</em>, and according to www.worldwildlife.org, "Pandas live mainly in temperate forests high in the mountains of southwest China,"</li>
	</ol>
  <h2 style = "font-size: 35px">What do Pandas like to eat?<h2>
	<ol class="customIndent" style = "background-color:darkseagreen; font-size: 20px">
	 <li>Bamboo? You've guessed it! Meals of Pandas' consists of <strong>26 to 84</strong> pounds of bamboo! <strong>99%</strong> of the meals of panda's consist of Bamboo, then what about the <u>1%</u>? That consists of plants and meats.</li>
	</ol>
  <h2 style = "font-size: 35px">What do Pandas do the whole day?</h2>
	<ol class="customIndent" style = "background-color:darkseagreen; font-size: 20px">
	  <li>The lives of pandas mostly consist of eating and sleeping, like other mammals, but they do explore the forest, by walking on their legs, and they do climb on trees. If pandas are at zoos, then they like to play with items that can improve the <u>smartness</u> of the animals. An example of an item can be, a puzzle, and when the panda solves it, they get a bamboo as their reward</li>

		There are many things I like to do, <em>but above</em>, are just a few <strong>major/key</strong> things I like to do. Other than that, I like to play play Fifa, Nba2k, chess, and watch guitar videos. I am in 8th Grade and I go to Middle School. I also love playing chess. I started grinding Chess when I was 11 and still am.
	</p> 

	<p style="font-size: 20px; color: green ">
		I learned it all by myself, I had just explored, and beat most of the chess.com bots. The worst bot was Nelson. I even watched a lot of chess videos, on YouTube and Twitch!

	<p style="font-size: 20px; color: green "><strong>What is happening in my life right now?</strong></p>
    
	<p style="font-size: 20px; ">
		Nothing, it's Winter break right now, so I am just chilling with no Homework. I have all A's or 4.0 GPA. I am working on python a lot and I am practicing a lot of Guitar, I can play a couple of songs. I can't even play basketball outside, because it is freezing and raining, I do have an indoor hoop which does come in handy when I am really bored. I have given up pretty much all entertainment including Video games and movies, except YouTube. I do feel guilty when watching Youtube, I feel like I am wasting my time, so that is gone for me right now too. My Dad always says, there should always be a balance of stuff, 75% studying, and maybe 25% entertainment. My Dad is a software engineer, and when I look at his computer screen, it is so confusing (random letters in the middle of sentences), just like when I started coding. I started coding with an easy language, Python, my dad uses C++. Since I know HTML and bits of CSS, I thought I could make myself a site about me; like a BIO. And here I am now, just typing paragraphs! When I am bored, I just play chess, watch Python videos, play basketball with my mini indoor hoop, or my last resort is to play <em>Fifa or Nba2k</em>. But these are fun games for a while, but after that, it gets very boring. I have always wondered that to code these games, it must take years or even decades because there would be so many statements.

<p style="font-size: 20px; color: green;">To the right is a picture of me. And you can probably guess what I am doing in the picture by looking at it. I didn't want to be in the picture, but my mom made me so she can send the picture to my Grandfather. It's pretty self-explanatory, but I am hanging on ornaments, on the Christmas Tree so it really actually looks like a Christmas Tree and not some random tree in the middle of the house. But since this holiday happens once a year, I am forced into taking pictures. I never really liked taking pictures, but I have no choice. I have got to say, it was pretty fun!</p>
	<br>
<p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>My Goals in Life:</strong></p>
	<ul style=" color:white font-size: 20px">
		<li>One of my Goals in life is to get into a good college and study Robotics </li>
		<li>Another goal in my life is to become a professional guitarist, which may not be possible, but I will try a lot. I got into guitar right after my parents bought me a new guitar, and the sound was incredible! So I just kept on going on classes, since 4th grade, and now I am intermediate at guitar</li>
		<li> Lastly, my goal is to become a professional basketball player, because I love playing it and it's really fun to watch. I have mentioned before, that I have an indoor hoop and a outdoor hoop, which I use and practice whenever I am bored.
