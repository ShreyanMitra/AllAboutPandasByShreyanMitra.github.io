  <h2 style = "font-size: 35px">Where are pandas from?:</h2>
	<ol style = "background-color:darkseagreen; font-size: 20px">
	 <li>Pandas are generally found in <em>Southwest China</em>, and according to www.worldwildlife.org, "Pandas live mainly in temperate forests high in the mountains of southwest China,"</li>
	</ol>
  <h2 style = "font-size: 35px">What do Pandas like to eat?</h2>
  	<ol style = "background-color:darkseagreen; font-size: 20px">
	 <li>Bamboo? You've guessed it! Meals of Pandas' consists of <strong>26 to 84</strong> pounds of bamboo! <strong>99%</strong> of the meals of panda's consist of Bamboo, then what about the <u>1%</u>? That consists of plants and meats.</li>
	</ol>
  <h2 style = "font-size: 35px">What do Pandas do the whole day?</h2>
	<ol style = "background-color:darkseagreen; font-size: 20px">
	  <li>The lives of pandas mostly consist of eating and sleeping, like other mammals, but they do explore the forest, by walking on their legs, and they do climb on trees. If pandas are at zoos, then they like to play with items that can improve the <u>smartness</u> of the animals. An example of an item can be, a puzzle, and when the panda solves it, they get a bamboo as their reward</li>

		Fun Facts about <em>Pandas!:</em>
	</p> 

	<ul style="font-size: 20px; color: White ">
		<li>One interesting fun fact about pandas, is their hand has an extended wrist bone, which can be used like thumb to <u>grip</u> on surrounding things, or to eat bamboo.</li>
		<li>Did you know Pandas spend <strong>12-16</strong> hrs a day eating Bamboo?!</li>
		<li>Also, Pandas poo around <u>40</u> times a day!!!</li>
	</ul>
<p style="font-size: 20px"><abbr title="<em>Why so?</em>"><strong>WHY?</strong></abbr>Since pandas, spend around 12-16hrs a day, eating, around anywhere from 26 pounds to 84 pounds, is the reason why pandas poop a lot. They also poop a lot because bamboos have very good fibre. </p>
	<ul style="font-size: 20px; color: White ">
		<li>In addition, the communication of pandas are really interesting. One would be vocallizing like we all do, and another is via scent marking. Meaning they spread a waxy substance, which is used to communicate</li>
		<li>Lastly, an absurd but interesting fact is, a panda can abandon a child if it has twins. This is because she will feed the one which is more stronger than the other one.</li>
	</ul>	
	




	<p style="font-size: 35px; color: green "><strong>Will pandas go extinct?</strong></p>
    
	<p style="font-size: 20px; ">
		Yes, sadly, pandas will go extinct in the near future. And that would be 100% our fault; their habitat day by day is decreasing because of infrastructure development, meaning people making properties like, dams, roads, railways, houses, and all sorts of other stuff is ruining the habitats of Pandas. Researchers say, pandas will go extinct as soon as 2025! That's 3 years from now!! Another reason why pandas will go extinct is because of their diet. They eat a lot of bamboo, but the problem in bamboo is, it has a lot off <ul>indigestable</ul> fibre than protein. Lastly pandas will go extincr is because of poaching. Many people poach pandas because their skins are worth a lot and so is their meat. One solution is to use less paper, that is because bamboo trees are being cut down, which produce paper and destroy the habitat of pandas.

	<p style="font-size: 35px; color: green "><strong>History of Pandas: </p>
<p style="font-size: 20px; color: green;">Pandas originally came from Europe not Asia. A French zoologist and priest named Father Armand David had found a panda pelt and skeleton, and he had sent this to Paris at the year of 1869. According to https://www.pdxwildlife.com/, "Long before Western cultures embraced the lovable black and white panda, they were a staple figure in Chinese art dating back thousands of years. Giant Pandas became known to the world in 1936 when Ruth Harkness captured a nine week old panda cub and brought it to the USA."</p>
	<br>
<p style="font-size: 35px;"><strong>What should you do to prevent extinction of pandas?</strong></p>
	<p style="font-size: 20px;">According to https://www.worldwildlife.org/, you should follow these steps:</p>
	<ol style=" color:white font-size: 20px">
		<li>Increasing the area of panda habitat under legal protection.</li>
		<li>Creating green corridors to link isolated pandas.</li>
		<li>Patrolling against poaching, illegal logging, and encroachment.</li> 
		<li>Building local capacities for nature reserve management.</li>
		<li>Continuing research and monitoring.</li>
	</ol>
