		There are many things Shreyan likes to do, <em>but above</em>, are just a few <strong>major</strong> things he likes to do. Things he also likes to do is play Fifa, Nba2k, chess, and watch guitar videos. He is in 8th Grade and goes to Pine Valley Middle School in San Ramon.

	</p> 

	<p style="font-size: 20px; color: green ">
		He learned it all by himself, he just explored, and beat most of the chess.com bots, the worst bot was Nelson. Shreyan even watched a lot of chess videos, on YouTube and Twitch!

	<p style="font-size: 20px; color: green "><strong>What is happening in my life right now?</strong></p>
    
	<p style="font-size: 20px; ">
		Nothing, it's Winter break right now, so I am just chilling with no Homework. I have all A's or 4.0 GPA. I am working on python a lot and I am practicing a lot of Guitar, I can play a couple of songs. I can't even play basketball outside, because it is freezing and raining, I do have an indoor hoop which does come in handy when I am really bored. I have given up pretty much all entertainment including Video games and movies, except YouTube. I do feel guilty when watching Youtube, I feel like I am wasting my time, so that is gone for me right now too. My Dad always says, there should always be a balance of stuff, 75% studying, and maybe 25% entertainment. My Dad is a software engineer, and when I look at his computer screen, it is so confusing (random letters in the middle of sentences), just like when I started coding. I started coding with an easy language, Python, my dad uses C++. Since I know HTML and bits of CSS, I thought I could make myself a site about me; like a BIO. And here I am now, just typing paragraphs! When I am bored, I just play chess, watch Python videos, play basketball with my mini indoor hoop, or my last resort is to play <em>Fifa or Nba2k</em>. But these are fun games for a while, but after that, it gets very boring. I have always wondered that to code these games, it must take years or even decades because there would be so many statements.

<p style="font-size: 20px; color: green;">To the right is a picture of me. And you can probably guess what I am doing in the picture by looking at it. I didn't want to be in the picture, but my mom made me so she can send the picture to my Grandfather. It's pretty self-explanatory, but I am hanging on ornaments, on the Christmas Tree so it really actually looks like a Christmas Tree and not some random tree in the middle of the house. But since this holiday happens once a year, I am forced into taking pictures. I never really liked taking pictures, but I have no choice. I have got to say, it was pretty fun!</p>
	<br>
<p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>My Goals in Life:</strong></p>
	<ul style=" color:green font-size: 20px">
		<li>One of my Goals in life is to go to UCLA, and study Robotics there because that subject really interests me. Not only that we will need it later in the future. Robots will replace simple jobs like getting a vaccination (The robot will take blood tests and all the samples) with complicated jobs like doing surgery. The best part, there is no chance of mistakes if coded correctly.</li>
		<li>Another goal in my life is to become a professional guitarist, which may not be possible, but I will try a lot. I got into guitar right after my parents bought me a new guitar, and the sound was incredible! So I just kept on going on classes, since 4th grade, and now I am intermediate at guitar</li>
		<li> Lastly, my goal is to become a professional basketball player, because I love playing it and it's really fun to watch. I have mentioned before, that I have an indoor hoop and a outdoor hoop, which I use and practice whenever I am bored.
